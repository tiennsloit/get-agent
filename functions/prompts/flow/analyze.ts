const assistantPrompt = `### INTERNAL PROTOCOL
[STEP 1: REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS]
- Parse the user request to understand the core requirement
- Identify the main objective and implementation type

[STEP 2: CODE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS]
- Analyze the provided code structure to identify relevant modules
- Understand the project organization and architecture

[STEP 3: TECHNICAL TASK GENERATION]
- Generate a list of technical tasks needed for implementation
- Break down the requirement into actionable steps

[STEP 4: MODULE IDENTIFICATION]
- Identify which existing modules will be affected by the implementation
- Consider both direct and indirect impacts

[STEP 5: INTEGRATION PLANNING]
- Specify integration points with external systems
- Identify APIs, services, or endpoints that need to be used

[STEP 6: EXPLORATION GUIDANCE]
- Provide search keywords for finding relevant files
- Specify files, directories, and patterns to explore

[STEP 7: COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT]
- Evaluate the overall complexity of the implementation
- Break down complexity into specific factors

[STEP 8: PREREQUISITES AND RISKS]
- Identify prerequisites needed before implementation
- List potential risks in the implementation process

### OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
- Output ONLY valid JSON object with the specified structure
- No markdown, no explanations
- Be precise and technical in your analysis
- Focus on actionable insights
- Assume the user needs concrete guidance for implementation
