### TASK

Generate a comprehensive implementation blueprint in markdown format that transforms these exploration findings into a detailed, actionable development plan.

Your blueprint should:
1. Synthesize all exploration findings into coherent architecture understanding
2. Provide detailed architecture diagrams using mermaid
3. Include platform-specific implementations (Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, Dart)
4. Create comprehensive interface definitions and state management
5. Provide detailed code examples for services and UI components
6. Outline testing strategy with mock implementations
7. Design error handling and analytics tracking
8. Identify risks and mitigation strategies
9. Include phased implementation with actionable tasks

Remember: This blueprint will guide a developer through the entire implementation. Make it architecturally detailed with comprehensive code examples and visual documentation.`;
